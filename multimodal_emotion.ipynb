    "The task is to use the feature-level method to combine facial expression features and audio features. A multi-modal emotion recognition system is constructed to recognize happy versus sadness facial expressions (binary-class problem) by using a classifier training and testing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data is based on lab1 and lab2, from ten actors acting happy and sadness behaviors. \n",
    "* Task 1: Subspace-based feature fusion method: In this case, z-score normalization is utilized. Please read “Fusing Gabor and LBP feature sets for kernel-based face recognition” and learn how to use subspace-based feature fusion method for multi-modal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Task 2: Based on Task 1, use Canonical Correlation Analysis to calculate the correlation coefficients of facial expression and audio features. Finally, use CCA to build a multi-modal emotion recognition system. The method is described in one conference paper “Feature fusion method based on canonical correlation analysis and handwritten character recognition”\n",
